# facial-landmark-detection

Facial landmark recognition allows you to detect a number of different points on your face that together make up your eyes, mouth, ears, nose and so on. From there you&#39;re able to apply overlays aka filters to get your snap! But there&#39;s so much more that it can be used for like emotion analysis and face tracking. youtu.be/7lXYGDVHUNw. github.com/nicknochnack/FacialLandmarkDetection
